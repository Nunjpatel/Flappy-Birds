# Flappy Birds Unity Game ðŸŽ®

Welcome to my Flappy Birds game project! This is my first venture into game development using Unity, where I designed and built the entire game from scratch. Despite being a beginner with game engines, I explored Unity's features, tackled challenges, and learned a lot throughout the process.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
For this project, I chose to create a game using Unity, one of the most popular game engines. After thorough research and hours of YouTube tutorials, I decided on the classic game **Flappy Birds** as my inspiration. This project helped me understand game development fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with Unity.

### ðŸ›  Features Implemented
1. **Game Physics**: 
   - Gravity effects to simulate the bird's fall.
   - Velocity adjustments for the bird's jump mechanic when the spacebar is pressed.
   - Friction and collision detection for a realistic gameplay experience.
2. **Sprite Renderer**:
   - Imported and displayed images for the bird and pipes using Unity's sprite renderer.
   - Utilized online resources for images to represent characters and obstacles.
3. **Collision Detection**:
   - Applied circle colliders to the bird and pipes for accurate collision interactions.
4. **Pipe Spawning**:
   - Created scripts to randomly generate pipes at varying sizes and intervals.
5. **C# Scripting**:
   - Built game logic, such as player controls and obstacle movements, using Unity's integration with Visual Studio 2022.

### ðŸš§ Challenges and Learnings
- Debugging scripts and optimizing game performance.
- Experimenting with Unity's gravity and velocity features to achieve smooth gameplay.
- Familiarizing myself with Unity's interface and documentation to implement collision detection and random object generation.
- Understanding the intricacies of Unity's collider system, even when working with non-circular sprites.

### ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
Given more time, I would like to:
- Add a scoring system and end-game mechanics to enhance player engagement.
- Implement sound effects for actions like collisions and wing flaps using Unity's audio source component.
- Refine the random pipe generation logic for smoother gameplay.
- Include additional features like background music, animations, and dynamic levels.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- **Controls**: Press the spacebar to make the bird jump.
- **Objective**: Navigate the bird through the pipes without colliding with them.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C# (via Visual Studio 2022)
- **Assets**: Online images for sprites (bird and pipes)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
This project marked my first experience with game development and using Unity. It challenged me to learn new skills, from scripting to debugging, and gave me a strong foundation for exploring more advanced game development projects in the future.
